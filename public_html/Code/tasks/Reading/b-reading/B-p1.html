            Need money? Then study up! Some cities are offering kids cash for doing well in school. In New York City, some fourth graders will receive up to $25 this year for every state test they ace. Schools in other states also offer incentives: In one Massachusetts town, kids receive $25 for perfect attendance. In Dallas, some schools motivate, or encourage, kids by giving students $2 for every book they read. Some people say the incentives are a good way to motivate kids to study. Others say paying children to learn is wrong because kids are the ones who benefit from schoolwork.
