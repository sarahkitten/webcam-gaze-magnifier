Unused

This folder contains unused scripts and HTML pages.  Some are copied over from Maus et al., 
and some were used for earlier prototypes and versions of the final gaze magnifier / experiment.

Study1Reading and Study1Target contain the HTML task pages used by Maus et al. for their first of two experiments-- 
we used the smaller set of tasks from their second experiment (found in the Tasks folder).
Analysis and PythonScripts were also used by Maus et al. but were not relevant to us.

MagReading and MagTarget contain the HTML task pages we used for our first of two experiments.
This experiment used a mouse-controlled magnifier that was the predecessor to our gaze-controlled magnifier,
and separated each task into multiple pages rather than using one page with multiple images.
Tasks were progressed through by clicking on images of buttons, rather than with key controls.
File paths may need to be adjusted for these pages to work properly.
