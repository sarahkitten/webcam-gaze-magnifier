            Garry Golden sits in a small cafe in Brooklyn, New York. In front of him, sheets of paper with diagrams litter the table. He rapidly sketches trains, cars and highways as he explains his ideas. Garry Golden has one passion: transportation. The science of how to move people from place to place fascinates him. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But heâ€™s most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the next 20 years.
