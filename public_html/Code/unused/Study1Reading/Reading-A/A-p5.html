            One night in March 2014, mud broke loose from a tall hillside near the town of Oso, Washington. The giant mass of wet soil moved downhill quickly. It eventually covered thirty nearby houses with mud and dirt. Many people were hurt.  Landslide is the word many people use to describe this kind of emergency. This landslide happened when very heavy rains soaked the ground near Oso.
