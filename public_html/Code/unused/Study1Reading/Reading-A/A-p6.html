            By the age of 30, Lea Tambellini had run more than five marathons and had no plans to stop. She had always been an athlete. When she was in high school, she swam on her schoolâ€™s swim team and ran to stay healthy and active. Her mom and dad ran marathons, and when she was 22, they helped her train for her first marathon.
