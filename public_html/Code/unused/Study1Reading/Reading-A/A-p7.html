            After the game, Gustavo and Felipe stay on the field to practice. Gustavo shows Felipe how he kicks with his lucky left foot. When Felipe tries to kick the ball, it goes in the wrong direction. Gustavo doesnâ€™t laugh at Felipe. Instead, he looks and sees that Felipe is kicking the wrong part of the ball with his foot. Gustavo shows Felipe where to kick the ball, and already Felipe is a little bit better. The rest of the week Gustavo and Felipe practice on the soccer field after the other boys leave. Felipe also practices kicking the ball before school. The next week Felipe scores his first goal, and Gustavo gives him a big high-five. Now Felipe looks forward to playing soccer every day, and Gustavo has a new friend.
