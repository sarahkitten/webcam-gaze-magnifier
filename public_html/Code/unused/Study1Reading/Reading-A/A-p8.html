            Pluto was first discovered in 1930. Until 2006, students were taught that it was the ninth and smallest planet in the solar system. Smaller than Earth’s moon, it is not even as wide as the United States.  Pluto is made up almost entirely of rock and ice. It is so far away that it took the NASA New Horizons spacecraft over 11 years to get there from Earth. Pluto’s full orbit around the sun lasts almost 250 Earth years!
