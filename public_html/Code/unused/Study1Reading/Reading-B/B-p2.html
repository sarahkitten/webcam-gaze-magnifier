            Esther Brunstein survived the Holocaust living in the notorious ghetto in the Polish city of Lodz. Located in central Poland, Lodz was home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe. The city fell to the Nazis soon after the Germans invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. Almost immediately, the Nazis began rounding up Jews and forcing them to live in a small section of Lodz. Ultimately, more than 200,000 would crowd into the walled ghetto. Entire families were packed into a single room.
