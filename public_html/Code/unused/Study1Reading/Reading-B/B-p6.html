            Becky Baumwoll never forgets her lines. That’s partly because there aren’t any lines in the plays she performs. Becky and her theater company, Broken Box, tell stories without using words. They wear white face paint and dress in black. Their plays are performed on an empty stage and without any props. But when the show begins, the empty stage suddenly looks like a desert, a castle, a forest, or a dining room. Without changing her costume, Becky transforms from a wiry old ogre, to a sparrow, to a cup full of Jell-O. Though her hands are empty, she seems to be holding a sword, a can of beans, or the reins of a horse. How can this happen? Are we under a spell? Does Becky know magic? Becky is a kind of actor called a mime.
