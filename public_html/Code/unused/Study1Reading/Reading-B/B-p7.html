            Many government groups prepare for possible disasters and respond to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created to help people both before and after disasters. FEMA does everything from helping make sure that buildings are designed to withstand damage to training emergency workers. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, many people criticized FEMA for not responding as well as it could have. There has even been talk of shutting FEMA down and creating a new agency. Other federal disaster responders include the National Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard. The National Guard is a group that can quickly be activated in the event of a national emergency, such as a hurricane, floods, or a war. The Coast Guard is the nation's oldest agency for protecting U.S. waters. It carries out search-and-rescue missions during and after disasters.
