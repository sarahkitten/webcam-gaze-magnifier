            On a cold morning in Austria, 16-year-old skier Ann Thompson was about to make her last practice run before lunch. At the time, Thompson was one of the United States' top junior skiers. She hoped to win an Olympic gold medal in skiing. As she prepared for that practice run, she couldn't know that it would be the last one she'd ever take. As she sped down the hill on her skis, Thompson had a terrible accident. She fell and severed her spinal cord. As a result of the accident, Thompson could no longer walk. Her skiing career was over. But her life as an athlete was not. Just over a year after her accident, Thompson was a top wheelchair athlete. Her sport was track and field. Thompson also joined the U.S. Paralympic team. In 1988, 1992, and 1996, she competed in track-and-field events. She won two gold medals, a silver medal, and two bronze medals.
