<h2>Webcam Gaze-controlled Screen Magnifier</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Sarah Kitten, and during my Summer 2021 work on the Rochester Institute of Technology Computational Sensing for Human-centered AI REU (research experience for undergraduates), I created a <strong>screen magnifier</strong> that <strong>tracks your eyes</strong> using your webcam and moves to the point on the screen that you're looking at.</p>
<p>Screen magnifiers are programs used by people with low vision in order to read text and see elements on a computer screen. However, it can be difficult to use a mouse to move the magnifier around the screen, and especially to move it left and right across lines of text when reading. Previous researchers have made downloadable magnifier programs controlled with infrared eye trackers-- my version is unique because it is fully <strong>web-based</strong> and uses an <strong>ordinary webcam</strong> instead of expensive equipment. My team tested the magnifier with people with low vision and found that a majority thought it was effective and easy to use.</p>
<h3>Try it out:</h3>
<p>Try out the magnifier with a blurred background to simulate low vision.  Press 'esc' for instructions and controls.&nbsp;</p>
